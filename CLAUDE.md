## Architecture & Structure

### Frontend Architecture (`src/`)

**Core Application:**
- `AppPhase2.tsx`: Current main app with tabbed interface (Phase 2)
- `main.tsx`: React application entry point using AppPhase2
- `hooks/useFileManager.ts`: Central state management for file operations and auto-save
- `hooks/useTabManager.ts`: Tab state management for multi-file editing
- `hooks/useFileWatcher.ts`: File system change detection
- `types/index.ts`: Complete TypeScript definitions for all phases

**Component Structure:**
- `components/tabs/`: Phase 2 tabbed interface
  - `TabManager.tsx`: Central tab management with keyboard shortcuts
  - `FileTab.tsx`: Individual tabs with close buttons and context menus
- `components/file-browser/`: Complete file management UI
  - `FileBrowserSidebar.tsx`: Main sidebar integrating folder selection, search, and file list
  - `FolderSelector.tsx`: Folder selection with manual path input fallback
  - `FileList.tsx`: File listing with search, create, and operations
  - `FileItem.tsx`: Individual file items with context menus for rename/delete
  - `FileSearch.tsx`: Real-time file search and filtering
- `components/editor/`: Enhanced text editing functionality
  - `EnhancedTextEditor.tsx`: Phase 2 main editor with preview modes
  - `CodeMirrorEditor.tsx`: Advanced CodeMirror integration with markdown support
  - `TextEditor.tsx`: Phase 1 basic editor (legacy)
  - `MarkdownPreview.tsx`: React-markdown based preview component
- `components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (Button, Dialog, Input, Card, etc.)

**Key Integration Points:**
- `useFileManager` hook centralizes all file state and operations
- `invoke()` calls for all Rust backend communication
- Absolute imports using `@/` prefix for clean module resolution

### Backend Architecture (`src-tauri/`)

**File Operations Core:**
- `commands/mod.rs`: Complete command handlers for all phases
  - File management: `select_folder`, `list_markdown_files`, `read_file`, `save_file`
  - File operations: `create_file`, `rename_file`, `delete_file`
  - Settings: `load_settings`, `save_settings` with persistent storage
  - File watching: `start_file_watcher`, `stop_file_watcher` with `notify` crate
  - System: `ping`, `get_app_version`, `check_permissions`
- `lib.rs`: Tauri app initialization with all commands registered
- All commands return `Result<T, String>` for consistent error handling

**Data Structures:**
- `MarkdownFile`: File metadata with id, name, path, size, last_modified
- `FileOperationResult`: Standardized result type for file operations
- `PermissionStatus`: System permission verification
- `UserSettings`: Persistent user preferences structure
- `FileChangeEvent`: File system change notifications for file watcher

### Communication Pattern

The app uses Tauri's `invoke()` system for frontend-backend communication:
- Frontend: `invoke<ReturnType>('command_name', { params })`
- Backend: `#[tauri::command]` annotated functions
- All commands return `Result<T, String>` for consistent error handling

### Phase-Based Development

**Completed:**
- **Phase 0**: Basic Tauri shell with working React frontend and Rust backend
- **Phase 1**: Complete MVP with file management, basic editing, auto-save, and file operations

**Current Phase (Phase 2) - Enhanced UX & Workflow:**
- âœ… Tabbed interface for multiple open files with tab management
- âœ… Enhanced CodeMirror editor with markdown support and shortcuts
- âœ… File watcher service for real-time external change detection
- âœ… Advanced editor modes with improved preview synchronization
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts for all major operations (Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+W, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced file operations (copy, move, batch operations) - planned
- ðŸ”„ Global search across all files - planned

**Future Phases:**
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features (global search, templates, settings persistence, system integration)

## Key Implementation Details

### Tauri Configuration
- **App ID**: `com.gtdspace.app`
- **Window**: 1200x800 default, 800x600 minimum, resizable
- **Plugins**: `tauri-plugin-fs` for file operations, `tauri-plugin-dialog` for system dialogs, `tauri-plugin-store` for settings persistence
- **Dev Tools**: Automatically opens in debug mode

- **Settings Persistence**: `tauri-plugin-store` for user preferences storage
- **Logging**: `env_logger` for development debugging
- **Error Types**: `thiserror` for structured error handling
- **Async Support**: `tokio` runtime for async operations and file watcher tasks

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. **Backend**: Add command handlers in `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` and register in `lib.rs`
2. **Types**: Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts` for new data structures
3. **Frontend**: Import commands via `invoke()` from `@tauri-apps/api/core`
4. **State Management**: Extend hooks (`useFileManager`, `useTabManager`, `useFileWatcher`) for state operations
5. **Components**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns and existing component structure
6. **Testing**: Use `npm run tauri:dev` to test full-stack functionality

### Code Architecture Patterns
- **State Management**: Multiple specialized hooks:
  - `useFileManager`: File operations and folder management
  - `useTabManager`: Multi-file tab state and operations
  - `useFileWatcher`: External file change detection
- **Component Props**: All components extend `BaseComponentProps` with className and standard props
- **Error Handling**: All Tauri commands return `Result<T, String>` with user-friendly error messages
- **File Operations**: Use standardized `FileOperationResult` type for create/rename/delete operations
- **Tab Management**: Tab-based auto-save with per-file unsaved change tracking

### Working with Phase 2 Enhanced UX
- **Current App**: `AppPhase2.tsx` is the active main component using tabbed interface
- **Tab Management**: `TabManager` component handles tab bar, overflow, and keyboard shortcuts
- **File Browser**: All file operations go through `FileBrowserSidebar` â†’ `FileList` â†’ `FileItem` hierarchy
- **Editor Integration**: `EnhancedTextEditor` with `CodeMirrorEditor` for improved markdown editing
- **File Watching**: External changes detected via `useFileWatcher` with automatic file list refresh
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive shortcuts (Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Shift+S)
- **Manual Folder Selection**: `FolderSelector` includes fallback manual path input for Tauri dialog limitations
- **Search**: Real-time filtering implemented in `FileList` component with `useMemo` optimization

### Key Configuration Files
- `package.json`: Frontend dependencies and npm scripts
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: Rust dependencies and Tauri plugins
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: Tauri app configuration and window settings
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite bundler configuration with Tauri integration and path aliases

## Important Implementation Details

### Known Limitations and Current Workarounds
- **Folder Selection**: Tauri 2.x dialog API has changed - current implementation includes manual path input fallback
- **File Watching Events**: Simplified event types (uses "changed" for all event types due to debouncer abstraction)
- **Tab Limit**: Hard limit of 10 tabs to prevent memory issues - oldest inactive tabs auto-close
- **Global Search**: Not yet implemented - only file name filtering available

### Tab-Based Auto-Save System
The auto-save implementation in Phase 2 uses per-tab tracking:
- Each tab maintains its own `hasUnsavedChanges` state
- Debounced auto-save triggers per tab content changes
- Visual feedback through tab indicators (orange dot for unsaved changes)
- Save all functionality for multiple tabs with unsaved changes
- Status indicators in header and status bar show save state

### File Operation Flow (Phase 2)
All file operations follow this enhanced pattern:
1. User action in UI (FileList, FileItem components, or tab interactions)
2. Operation request via `handleFileOperation` in `useFileManager` or `useTabManager`
3. Backend Rust command execution with error handling
4. State update in relevant hook (file manager, tab manager)
5. Tab synchronization (close tabs for deleted files, update tab names for renames)
6. File watcher events may trigger additional UI updates
7. User feedback via notifications, status indicators, or visual state changes
