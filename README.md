## GTD (Getting Things Done) System

GTD Space is designed from the ground up around David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology:

### GTD Structure

- **Horizons of Focus** - Each horizon as a dedicated folder with individual pages:
  - **Purpose & Principles** (50,000 ft) - Core values and life mission documents
  - **Vision** (40,000 ft) - Your 3-5 year aspirational picture
  - **Goals** (30,000 ft) - Individual pages for each 1-2 year objective
  - **Areas of Focus** (20,000 ft) - Individual pages for ongoing responsibilities
- **Projects** - Outcome-focused goals with multiple actions
  - Each project is a folder with README.md for metadata
  - Actions are individual markdown files within project folders
  - See all actions directly in the sidebar
  - Example content is created on first run to help you get started
- **Actions** - Concrete next steps within projects
  - Interactive Status tracking (In Progress, Waiting, Complete) via single-select dropdowns
  - Interactive Effort estimates (Small <30min, Medium 30-90min, Large >90min, Extra Large >3hr) via single-select dropdowns
  - Optional focus dates (when to work on) and due dates (deadlines)
  - References to Cabinet and Someday Maybe pages for context and supporting materials
- **Habits** - Recurring routines with automatic tracking
  - Interactive checkbox for status (To Do / Complete) with real-time updates
  - Smart frequency options (Daily, Every Other Day, Twice Weekly, Weekly, Weekdays, Biweekly, Monthly)
  - Automatic status reset based on frequency intervals
  - Self-documenting history log with timestamps
  - Backfills missed periods when app was offline
  - Toast notifications and visual feedback on status changes
- **Someday Maybe** - Ideas for future consideration with full page creation support
- **Cabinet** - Reference materials with organized document storage

### Getting Started with GTD

On first launch, GTD Space automatically initializes your workspace at `~/GTD Space` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\\GTD Space` (Windows). It also seeds example projects and actions to demonstrate statuses, focus dates, due dates, and effort fields.

1. The default space is created or loaded automatically
2. Explore the seeded projects in `Projects/`
3. Create your own projects with clear outcomes and optional due dates
4. Add actions to projects - they appear instantly in the sidebar
5. Track progress with status updates

See [GTD Implementation](docs/GTD_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed usage.
