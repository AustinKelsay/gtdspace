# âœ… Release Setup Complete

## What Was Done

Your GTD Space build and release process is now fully configured! Here's what was set up:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **`.github/workflows/build.yml`**: Automated multi-platform builds on version tags
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: Continuous integration for code quality
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`**: Automated dependency updates

### 2. Version Management
- **`scripts/bump-version.js`**: Automated version bumping across all files
- **NPM scripts**: `version:major`, `version:minor`, `version:patch`, `release`

### 3. Tauri Configuration Fixed
- âœ… `bundle.active` set to `true` (was false - would have prevented builds!)
- âœ… Added platform-specific bundle configurations
- âœ… Updated bundle identifier and metadata

### 4. Icon Setup
- Created icon generation scripts (Python and Shell)
- Added temporary icon files to allow immediate builds
- GitHub Actions will auto-generate proper icons during builds

### 5. Documentation
- **`docs/release-process.md`**: Comprehensive release guide
- **`docs/build-setup.md`**: Build prerequisites and troubleshooting
- **`RELEASING.md`**: Quick reference for creating releases
- Updated README with download section

## Current Status

âœ… **Ready to create your first release!**

The temporary icon files have been created, so you can build immediately. The GitHub Actions workflow will generate properly sized icons automatically.

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit These Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add automated build and release process"
git push origin feature/release-process
```

### 2. Create a Pull Request
Merge your `feature/release-process` branch into `main`.

### 3. Create Your First Release
After merging to main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
npm run release  # Creates v0.1.1, tags, and pushes
```

### 4. Monitor the Build
- Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AustinKelsay/gtdspace/actions) to watch the build progress
- The release will appear in [Releases](https://github.com/AustinKelsay/gtdspace/releases) when complete

## Important Notes

### Icons
- **Current state**: Using copied placeholders.
- **To generate locally**: Run `npm run icons:generate`. This will generate the necessary icons from `src-tauri/icons/icon.png`.
- **CI/CD**: Icons are automatically generated in GitHub Actions during the release process.

### Version Numbers
Currently synchronized at `{{version}}` in:
- `package.json`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`  
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

### Platform Builds
Each release will generate:
- Windows: `GTDSpace_{{version}}_windows-x64.msi`
- macOS Intel: `GTDSpace_{{version}}_macos-x64.dmg`
- macOS ARM: `GTDSpace_{{version}}_macos-aarch64.dmg`
- Linux: `GTDSpace_{{version}}_linux-x64.AppImage` and `GTDSpace_{{version}}_linux-x64.deb`

**Note**: Ensure the `VERSION` environment variable is set in your release pipeline to match the desired release version (e.g., `export VERSION=v0.1.1`) before packaging to ensure correct artifact naming.

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Code signing** for trusted installers
2. **Auto-update** functionality
3. **Beta/nightly** release channels
4. **Package manager** distribution (Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.)

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `docs/build-setup.md` for troubleshooting
2. Review GitHub Actions logs for build errors
3. Ensure all version numbers match across files

Your release pipeline is ready to go! ðŸš€
