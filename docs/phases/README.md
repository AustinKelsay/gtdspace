# Iterative Development Plan - Tauri Markdown Editor

> **Complete development roadmap from barebones setup to enterprise-ready markdown editor, progressing through functional products that each build on the previous phase.**

## Development Philosophy

This iterative development plan follows the principle of **functional progression** - each phase results in a working, potentially shippable product that delivers real value while laying the foundation for the next phase. Rather than building features in isolation, we build complete experiences that users can benefit from immediately.

### Core Principles
- **Working Software First:** Every phase produces a functional application
- **Incremental Value:** Each phase adds meaningful value over the previous
- **User-Centric Development:** Features are developed based on real user workflows
- **Technical Excellence:** Quality and architecture improve with each iteration
- **Sustainable Growth:** Each phase supports the complexity of future phases

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Status | Primary Value | User Experience |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Phase 0](#phase-0-setup) | 3-5 days | Foundation | Development environment | App opens, basic UI visible |
| [Phase 1](#phase-1-mvp) | 1-2 weeks | MVP | Core markdown editing | Usable markdown editor |
| [Phase 2](#phase-2-enhancement) | 1-2 weeks | Enhanced | Improved workflow | Professional editing experience |
| [Phase 3](#phase-3-advanced) | 2-3 weeks | Advanced | Rich content creation | Notion-like editing capabilities |
| [Phase 4](#phase-4-polish) | 1-2 weeks | Production-Ready | Professional polish | Commercial-grade application |
| [Phase 5](#phase-5-scalability) | 2-3 weeks | Enterprise-Ready | Power user features | Enterprise documentation platform |

**Total Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (2-3 months)

## Development Strategy

### Feature Development Approach

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Need Identified] --> B[Design Minimal Solution]
    B --> C[Implement Core Functionality]
    C --> D[Test with Real Users]
    D --> E[Iterate Based on Feedback]
    E --> F[Polish and Optimize]
    F --> G[Prepare for Next Phase]
    G --> A
```
