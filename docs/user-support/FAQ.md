## Getting Started

### Q: How do I open my first markdown file?
**A:** Click the folder icon in the sidebar or use `Ctrl+O` to select a folder containing markdown files. GTD Space will automatically scan and display all `.md` and `.markdown` files in that folder.

### Q: Can I use GTD Space without selecting a folder?
**A:** No, GTD Space is designed to work with local folders containing markdown files. You need to select a folder to begin editing. This ensures all your files stay organized and local.

### Q: Why isn't my file showing up in the file list?
**A:** GTD Space only displays files with `.md` and `.markdown` extensions. Make sure your file has the correct extension. If you just created the file outside GTD Space, try refreshing the file list with `F5`.

### Q: How do I create a new file?
**A:** Use `Ctrl+N` or click the "+" button next to the search bar in the sidebar. GTD Space will create a new markdown file in your selected folder.

**A:** Yes! GTD Space automatically saves your changes every few seconds. You'll see a green "Saved" indicator in the header when your work is saved. You can also manually save with `Ctrl+S`.

**A:** This usually happens when:
- The file was moved or deleted outside of GTD Space
- The file extension was changed to something other than `.md` or `.markdown`

- The folder path has changed

## Performance & Troubleshooting

### Q: GTD Space is running slowly. What can I do?
**A:** Try these solutions:
1. **Close unused tabs** - Each open file uses memory
2. **Restart the application** - This clears any memory leaks
3. **Check your folder size** - Folders with thousands of files may slow down the file browser
4. **Update GTD Space** - Performance improvements are released regularly

### Q: My file won't save. What's wrong?
**A:** Common causes:
- **File permissions** - Make sure you have write access to the file
- **File in use** - The file might be open in another application
- **Disk space** - Check if your drive has available space
- **File corruption** - Try copying the content to a new file

### Q: The application crashed. Will I lose my work?
**A:** GTD Space has auto-save and crash recovery features:
- **Auto-save** runs every few seconds while you type
- **Crash recovery** attempts to restore unsaved changes when you restart
- **Tab restoration** reopens your previously open files

### Q: Why can't I see my changes in preview mode?
**A:** Make sure:
- Your changes are saved (check the save indicator in the header)
- You're not in source-only mode
- Refresh the preview with `Ctrl+R` if needed
