pub const AREAS_OF_FOCUS_OVERVIEW_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# Areas of Focus (20,000 ft)

## What are Areas of Focus?

Areas of Focus are the ongoing roles and responsibilities you need to maintain in your life. Unlike projects which have specific outcomes and endpoints, these are areas that require continuous attention and balance.

## Review Questions
- Which areas are thriving? Which need more attention?
- Are all my projects aligned with these areas?
- What areas am I neglecting that need focus?
- Are there areas I should add or remove?

## Notes
Each area of focus has its own page in this folder. Review them during your weekly review to ensure you're maintaining balance across all important areas of your life.

## What are Goals?

Goals are specific achievements you want to accomplish within the next 1-2 years. They provide direction for your projects and help you make decisions about what to focus on.

## Success Metrics
- How will I know when I've achieved each goal?
- What milestones can I set along the way?
- Which goals are most important if I can't achieve all?

## Review Schedule
Review quarterly to assess progress and adjust as needed. Each goal has its own page in this folder for detailed tracking.

This is your personal Getting Things Done (GTD) space. The directory structure has been set up to help you organize your life across all horizons of focus:

## üéØ Horizons of Focus

### üìã Areas of Focus (20,000 ft)
Ongoing responsibilities and roles you maintain. Each area has its own page for tracking projects and metrics.

### üéØ Goals (30,000 ft)  
1-2 year objectives that guide your projects. Each goal has its own page with milestones and success criteria.

### üîÆ Vision (40,000 ft)
Your 3-5 year aspirational picture of where you're heading.

### ‚≠ê Purpose & Principles (50,000 ft)
Core values and life mission that drive everything.

## üìÅ Projects
Contains all your active projects. Each project is a folder with:
- A README.md file containing project details

### Project Structure:
```
Projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project overview and metadata

/// Template for Someday Maybe - Learn a New Language

- Enhances travel experiences in 20+ countries
- Cognitive benefits of bilingualism
- Career advancement opportunities
- Cultural enrichment and understanding

## Next steps when ready

- [ ] Research language learning methods (apps, classes, tutors)
- [ ] Set a realistic timeline and daily practice goal
- [ ] Find a conversation partner or language exchange
- [ ] Plan an immersion trip as a goal/reward
- [ ] Start with basic conversational phrases

/// Template for Cabinet - GTD Principles Reference
pub const CABINET_GTD_PRINCIPLES_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# GTD Principles Reference

## Reference

The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology by David Allen - Core principles and practices.

## Key Points

- **Capture**: Collect what has your attention in trusted external systems
- **Clarify**: Process what it means and what to do about it
- **Organize**: Put it where it belongs based on what it is
- **Reflect**: Review frequently to stay current and aligned
- **Engage**: Use your trusted system to take action with confidence

## Notes

### The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

1. **Capture** everything that has your attention
2. **Clarify** what each item means and what to do about it
3. **Organize** the results into trusted external systems
4. **Reflect** on your system regularly to keep it current
5. **Engage** with confidence in your moment-to-moment choices

### The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes to complete, do it now rather than adding it to your list.

### Weekly Review
- Get clear: Collect loose papers and materials, empty your head
- Get current: Review action lists, calendar, waiting-for lists
- Get creative: Review someday/maybe lists, trigger new ideas

### Natural Planning Model
1. Define purpose and principles
2. Envision the outcome
3. Brainstorm ideas
4. Organize into structure
5. Identify next actions
