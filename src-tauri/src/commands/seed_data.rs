/// Template content for the Horizons/Purpose & Principles file
pub const PURPOSE_PRINCIPLES_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# Purpose & Principles (50,000 ft)

## What are Purpose & Principles?

Your purpose is your "why" - the ultimate reason behind everything you do. Your principles are the core values that guide your decisions and actions. Together, they form the foundation of your life's direction.

## My Purpose

### Life Mission Statement
*Why do I exist? What am I here to contribute?*

[Write your personal mission statement here]

### Core Purpose Elements
- **To Create**: What do I want to bring into existence?
- **To Connect**: How do I want to relate to others?
- **To Contribute**: What legacy do I want to leave?
- **To Experience**: What do I want to learn and explore?

## My Principles & Values

### Core Values (Top 5-7)
1. **[Value]** - [What this means to me]
2. **[Value]** - [What this means to me]
3. **[Value]** - [What this means to me]
4. **[Value]** - [What this means to me]
5. **[Value]** - [What this means to me]

### Guiding Principles
*The non-negotiable standards by which I live:*

- I always...
- I never...
- I believe...
- I stand for...

### Decision Filters
When facing difficult decisions, I ask:
- Does this align with my purpose?
- Does this honor my values?
- Will I be proud of this choice in 10 years?
- Does this move me toward or away from who I want to be?

## Integration
- How do my current projects reflect my purpose?
- Where am I compromising my principles?
- What changes would bring more alignment?

## Reflection
This is the deepest level of GTD thinking. Review annually or when facing major life decisions.

pub const CABINET_GTD_PRINCIPLES_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# GTD Principles Reference

## Reference

The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology by David Allen - Core principles and practices.

## Key Points

- **Capture**: Collect what has your attention in trusted external systems
- **Clarify**: Process what it means and what to do about it
- **Organize**: Put it where it belongs based on what it is
- **Reflect**: Review frequently to stay current and aligned
- **Engage**: Use your trusted system to take action with confidence

## Notes

### The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

1. **Capture** everything that has your attention
2. **Clarify** what each item means and what to do about it
3. **Organize** the results into trusted external systems
4. **Reflect** on your system regularly to keep it current
5. **Engage** with confidence in your moment-to-moment choices

### The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes to complete, do it now rather than adding it to your list.

### Weekly Review
- Get clear: Collect loose papers and materials, empty your head
- Get current: Review action lists, calendar, waiting-for lists
- Get creative: Review someday/maybe lists, trigger new ideas

### Natural Planning Model
1. Define purpose and principles
2. Envision the outcome
3. Brainstorm ideas
4. Organize into structure
5. Identify next actions
